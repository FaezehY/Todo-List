# Todo-List
This is an environment to list all the desired task you plan to do. 

In this environment we have the following abilities:  
- Add a new item to list.
- Edit the existing item in the list.
- Toggle the completed item in the list.
- Toggle All the items in the list.
- Delete the unwanted item in the list.

For programming this project I used the core concepts of JavaScript such as: using objects, functions, higher order functions, call back, forEach instead of using for loops and accessing the DOM object with the help of using console.
Beside for debugging my code I used the debugger commant in the chrome.
